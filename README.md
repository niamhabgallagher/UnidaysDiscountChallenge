##Unidays Discount Challenge

#Running the Code

I have written my code in Java and it can be easily accessed with a text editor, I used atom for this project.

The code can be easily run through command line/terminal.
You can do this by opening the terminal and writing cd then copying the file directory.
You should then compile the code by writing:
javac UnidaysDiscountChallenge.java
and then run the code by typing:
java UnidaysDiscountChallenge
This should bring up a prompt for you to enter your order, after
pressing enter it should show the total order price and the delivery price and how much the total cost is

#How i approached the problem

When I first read the challenge I made notes on everything that needed done and all the requirements and the pricing rules so that I had them beside me to look at whenever I needed to see them.

I then had to make the decision of how I wanted to implement the challenge. I decided I would use the coding language I am most familiar with at the moment as it is what I am using most at university, which was Java. Then I decided that I would rather type out the code myself rather than use an IDE as I found that it would help me understand everything and any problems I had. I like writing it and running it through Terminal as I find this the easiest way and it is what I am most practiced at doing with university too.

I really enjoyed this challenge and felt accomplished and proud when I finished it.
